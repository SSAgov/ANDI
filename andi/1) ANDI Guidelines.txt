# Things that can be done on andi.js
  - work on removing functions that have one line of code within them
  - functions can be removed if they are not being used
    - List of removed functions with reason
      - disableModuleButton: Removed because I want all module buttons visible even if there is no content
                             for the module. That means it is not being used
  - Make all module buttons visible even if the have no content

# Things that can be changed
  - Make a table for each module and subsection in ANDI
    - Wait to simplify after tables have been added to other areas
  - Make a function like (function Links() for all module areas)
