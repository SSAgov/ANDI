tANDI 6.2.0
Highlighting now works properly with colgroup/rowgroup

ANDI 11.1.0
Change the behavior/look of the module buttons to resolve funky mouse hover usability issue

ANDI 11.0.0
Inspect hover event is fired on mouseenter instead of mouseover. This allows a focusable child to be able to be inspected by mouse when it is contained by a focusable parent!
Move module buttons to the far right to allow for more room for module action buttons
Made module buttons more intuitive by allowing hover/focus to spell out the function. Active module function will be spelled out
Module action buttons color will be color of active module

gANDI 2.0.0
remove inline image button will set the opacity to 10%, the alt text will not be displayed
remove background image button will set the opacity to 10% (however, this might be problematic, subject to change)
background images will no longer be in the "flow" of elements analyzed: Only inline images
(future update will incorporate image-links image-buttons)

lANDI 3.1.1
When link has target attribute, and name/description does not contain one of the words "new, open, window, tab", throw warning alert that says "Link opens new window or tab without notification."
When link has role=button throw caution alert asking user to check for spacebar key handling (I may be able to partially check for this automatically in future update)

fANDI 3.4.0
Show tab order button will take into account tabindexes that are greater than zero (it wasn't before, oops).
The number on the overlay flag will correspond to the unique sequence index that it occurs on the page.
When the tabindex is greater than zero, the flag will be orange
Negative tabindexes still red.
Title attributes are added to the flags. The title value will either read "tabindex=#" or "natively tabbable"

ANDI 10.1.0
Duplicate id overlay flags will have title attribute to distinguish for colorblind users.
The flag tabindexes will have the same tabindex as the element it associates with.

ANDI 10.0.0
Adjust framework to allow buttons to be inserted to the right of alert group messages
Added overlay class to handle creation/removal of overlays (tab order indicators, more in the future)
Overlays will have a tabindex of zero
The additions above allow for the following:
-Added a new button (show ids) that will appear when duplicate ids are found.
-Pressing the button adds overlays containing the element's id. Duplicates will have a red background (will add a title attribute in next update to distinguish for colorblind)

tANDI 5.3.0
Show scope, headers, and id no matter which mode is selected

tANDI 5.2.4

Danger alerts when marquee and blink tag are found
Danger alert when server side image map is found
Caution alert when alt text contains redundant text such as "image of"  "photo of"
Warning alert when alt text contains image file name such as ".png" ".gif" ".jpg" …
Danger alert when alt text is not descriptive enough (i.e. text exactly equals:  "image"  "photo"  "logo"  "icon" "graphic" "graph" "picture" "photograph")

lANDI 3.0.0
Change alert text for same name different href to: "Ambiguous Link: same name/description as another link but different href."

ANDI 9.8.2
Fixed bug where after ANDI launch if inspectable element got removed from DOM by application javascript, prev/next buttons would fail to shift focus.

tANDI 5.2.0
removed (commented out) arrow key navigation from 5.1.0

lANDI 2.2.0
Before throwing, "In-page anchor target not found" alert, check to see if link has onclick logic to prevent false positive. (links like this are being used for javascript purposes, not in-page jump link)

lANDI 2.1.0
Throws alert when it finds links with same name/description different href
Throws alert when it cannot find the anchor target of an in-page link
Throws alert when link text is vague and does not identify its purpose
Defaults to alert list, "show link list"

tANDI 4.2.1
Once the end/beginning of table has been reached on inspection, the Next Previous buttons will automatically jump to the next or previous table

tANDI 4.2.1

tANDI 4.2.0
In scope mode, output will include assumed th cell associations while inspecting td cells even if scope is not included
Fixed javascript error with presentation tables
Fixed nested table disappearing with nested presentation tables

tANDI 4.1.0
Nested tables now working properly: Outer table will ignore inner tables

tANDI 4.0.0
Tables are to be analyzed one at a time. "next table" button added to cycle through tables.
Scope level limit increased to 4 (alert is still a warning). Modified the logic so that it is fully scalable in case the number needs to be increased.
Presentation tables will trigger alerts when they contain, scope, headers, th, caption, or summary
Danger level "Scope required" alert removed.
Caution level "table has no scope" alert remains.
New danger alert "Scope association missing at &lt;th&gt; intersection." Triggered in this scenario:
Scope mode on
th is found without scope
th is at an x/y intersection of other th
Alert is thrown on the table, not on the th. Testers will have to find the problem cell themselves until I can modify the framework to add alerts to elements that ANDI has already finished analyzing.

ANDI 9.4.0
tANDI 3.2.1
Moved the scope button next to the logo to help draw more attention to it. Other modules may have similar button modes or display switches placed in this location.

ANDI 9.3.0
-At launch/relaunch, ANDI will always retain the previously focused element and immediately inspect it if it is "inspectable" by the active module, and keep the element in focus. If the element is not inspectable by the active module or nothing is in focus, focus will shift to the ANDI Bar.
-Horizontal Scrollbars (groan) of the test page will be retained instead of removed.

tANDI 2.5.0
Throw alert suggesting mode change when Header mode on and table has no headers but has scope

Next Prev buttons moved
