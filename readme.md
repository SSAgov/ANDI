## What problem does ANDI solve?

For many web developers, accessibility is an unfamiliar and complex territory and therefore often neglected. ANDI bridges the gap between developers and end users by revealing
where accessibility issues occur on the page. To accomplish this, it analyzes the HTML of the web page being tested and extracts accessibility related markup.

Users can visit this [installation page](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html) for browser installation instructions (includes keyboard accessible instructions).

If an organization wishes to host its own fork or copy of ANDI, [see this page for alternate hosting instructions](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html#github).
